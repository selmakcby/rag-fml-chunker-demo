A living area, often referred to as a living room or lounge, typically features furniture such as sofas, armchairs, and coffee tables for seating and relaxation [1]. It may also include items like televisions, bookshelves, and decorative elements that reflect the homeowner's personal style [2]. The layout can vary significantly, with some living areas being open plan and connected to dining or kitchen spaces, while others are more enclosed and separate. The size of the living area can depend on the overall size of the house or apartment [3].
